Our "secret sauce" will lie in the "ASAP" Button, which is the equivalent of 911 for academic needs. Our biggest competitor is Tutree, and we have what they lack - a fully functional web-based platform. We made the entire process dead simple more so than them or any other competitor. Sign-up/Verified within seconds. 

As Mark Cuban would say, "You gotta do your homework then kick everyone else's ass". No one knows this field more than we do. We've done our homework, and now we're definitely ready to kick some ass.
