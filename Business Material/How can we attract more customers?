Demo it as part of the story the price is too high. - BY THE WAY, you can set your own schedule.

Imagine you need a tutor right now, but you don't see any available, and in our backend, we text all offline with an price offer. Whichever tutor responds first will get the job. The price will be shown to the tutor and will increase over time until either the request is cancelled or a tutor accepted it.
